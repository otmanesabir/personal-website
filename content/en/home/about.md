This is <strong>me</strong>, a computer science student at <a href="https://jacobsuniversity.de">Jacobs University</a>. I'm devoted towards learning more about grounded architechtures of cognition and the collaboration of neuroscience and machine learning. I also love visual arts, whether in the form of photography, videography, graphic design or animations. Camera's built me a second world, a playground where I ruled all the variables and was able to shape visions the very way I perceived them. Here and now, this obsession embodies a second realm. An outbreak from realism and a different way of taking pleasure of the world - one where moments are frames and movements are emotions.
