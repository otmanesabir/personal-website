I am devoted to learning more about grounded architectures of cognition and the collaboration of neuroscience and machine learning. I am currently working as an Intern Software Engineer at ELISE, - developing new software features, implementing geometrical algorithms, and extending the applications API.
I also love visual arts, whether in the form of photography, videography, graphic design, or animations. Cameras built me a second world, a playground where I ruled all the variables and was able to shape visions the very way I perceived them. Here and now, this obsession embodies a second realm. An outbreak from realism and a different way of taking pleasure of the world - one where moments are frames and movements are emotions.
