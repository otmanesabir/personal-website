I also really enjoy doing organizational work. I have organized multiple events in my time at Jacobs University and more during high school. I was the main organizer for Jacobs University's orientation week 2019 - the biggest edition in the history of Jacobs University - and was in charge of supervising a team of 100 people and welcoming more than 500 students - you can read more about my experience [here](https://jacobsuniversity.blog/august-2019/humans-of-jacobs-otmane). Additionally, I was the main organizer for [JacobsHack! 2020](https://mega.nz/folder/fR502QaL#6zbhyAyllCJ2VK7Ztxa9lA) - the biggest hackathon in Germany -, leading a group of 40 students and receiving about 200 participants.
