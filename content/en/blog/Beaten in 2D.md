Today (June 29th at 17:59) I started working on Voronoi 3D. I'll be documenting my experience throughout :) There are a lot of things to be done but I'll lay out step by step what I have to do. If you don't know the story, I lost to Voronoi in 2D, pretty bad.. but this is my chance to retaliate. I'm shooting my shot and I'll see how this goes :) First, I want to try to update Qhull in our project to the new 2020 release

+ Update qhull to the latest stable release :)
