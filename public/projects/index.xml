      <description>I also really enjoy doing organizational work. I have organized 8 events in my 2 years at Jacobs University and more during my highschool. I was the main organizer for Jacobs University&amp;rsquo;s orientation week 2019 which was the biggest edition in the history of Jacobs University such that I was in charge of handling a team of 100 people. Additionally, I was the main orgnaizer for JacobsHack!, the biggest hackathon in Germany leading a team of 40 students and hosting around 200 participants.</description>
